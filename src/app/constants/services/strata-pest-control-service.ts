			"Living in a strata property brings convenience, community, and shared responsibility. But when pests move in, they don't just stay in one unit — they spread quickly through common walls, ceilings, and shared spaces. That's why strata pest control in Sydney requires a specialist approach designed for multi-dwelling buildings. At Ecovia, we work with strata managers, body corporates, and property owners to keep entire complexes pest-free. From cockroaches in shared kitchens to rodents in bin rooms, our team delivers fast, eco-friendly, and effective solutions backed by professional reporting and service guarantees.",
